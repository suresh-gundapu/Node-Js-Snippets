/**Understanding Event Loop & Callbacks
ðŸ‘‰ Event Loop is the mechanism that handles asynchronous operations in Node.js.

ðŸ”¹ Example: Callback Execution in Event Loop */
console.log("Step 1");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Step 2 (Asynchronous)");
}, 2000);

console.log("Step 3");
// Output:ðŸ‘‰ Why? Because setTimeout is non-blocking and runs after other synchronous code finishes execution.

//ðŸ‘‰ Event Loop is the mechanism that handles asynchronous operations in Node.js.
//ðŸ‘‰ It allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations despite the fact that JavaScript is
//  single-threaded.
//ðŸ‘‰ The Event Loop is a loop that checks the Call Stack and Callback Queue.
// If the Call Stack is empty,
//  it will take the first event from the Callback Queue and push it to the Call Stack.
//ðŸ‘‰ This is how Node.js handles asynchronous operations and callbacks.
//ðŸ‘‰ The Event Loop is the secret behind Node.js's non-blocking I/O operations.
