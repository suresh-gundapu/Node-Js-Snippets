ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Understand how Node.js works, write basic programs, and use core modules.

âœ… Install Node.js & NPM (Check version: node -v, npm -v)
âœ… Understanding Blocking vs Non-Blocking (Asynchronous) Execution
âœ… Learn Global Objects (__dirname, __filename, process, console)
âœ… Work with Core Modules:

fs (File System) â€“ Read/Write Files
http â€“ Create a Basic Web Server
path â€“ File Path Manipulation
os â€“ System Information
âœ… Understanding Event Loop & Callbacks
ðŸ“Œ Hands-on Task:

Create a simple "Hello, Node.js!" script
Read & Write files using the fs module
Create a basic HTTP server using the http module

Node Js:
========

Node Js is a run time execution environment that excutes  Javascript code outside browser(servers).

-> intially node js is client side scripting menas always executes by browsers, in 2009 rhyan dhan made 

NodeJs = c++ and chrome v8 enjine 

-> It build at google chrome JS v8 engine

Features:
========

-> Dynamic web pages : server-side we can make dynamic apps

-> Free to use and open source
-> cross platform --supports all operating sustems
-> Very fastest language beacuse internally used js v8 engine 
-> I/O -non blocking model: the file and db operations done asynchromously means server executes another request while file /db connection or response underprocesss


Applications:
============

-> I/O bound Applications
-> live data streaming Applications
-> Json api based Applications
-> SPA
