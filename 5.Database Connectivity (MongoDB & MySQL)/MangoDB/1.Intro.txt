 1️⃣ What is MongoDB?
 ====================
👉 MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in documents (JSON format) instead of tables.
👉 It is schema-less, meaning we don't need to define a strict structure for our 
data like SQL databases.
👉 It scales easily, making it great for high-traffic applications.

✅ MongoDB Example Document (Stored in Collection)


{
  "_id": "6510abcd1234",
  "name": "Suresh",
  "email": "suresh@gmail.com",
  "age": 28
}
✅ MongoDB stores data in a collection (similar to a SQL table), but it's flexible!
